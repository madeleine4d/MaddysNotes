- localize the lesion
	- which cerebral hemi?
	- internal capsule?
	- brainstem: di-, mes-, met- or myelencephalon?
	- spinal cord?
	- peripheral (or cranial) nerves?
	- NM juncture?
	- muscle?

history:
ask about…
- past medical history
- present meds
- mad allergies
- family medical history
- social history
- review of systems
- demographics (including handedness)
- symptoms
	- temporality of presentation
	- change over time
	- anatomic distribution
	- triggers or relivers 
	- severity (1 to 10)

## motor exam
normal:
nl bulk and tone, 5/5 strength throughout, no involuntary movements

Bulk:
atrophy can indicate lower motor neuron diseases
also look for fibrillations

Tone can be:
normal
decreased of flaccid
increased
 - velocity independent (rigid)
	 - resistance to all movements
 - velocity dependent (spastic)
	 - fast movement have higher resistance
paratonia (“I could not figure it out”)

grading:
0 - no movement 
1 - flicker of movement only
2 - movement but not against gravity
3 - movement against gravity but not full range of motion
4 - “breakable” weakness
5- nl strength 

myopathic pattern weakness (weakness of proximal muscles): muscle problem or NMJ problem 
neuropathic pattern weakness (weakness of distal muscles):
peripheral neuropathy

Document involuntary movements;

| Name           | Movement                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Tremor         | small rhythmic oscillating movements |
| Chorea         | flit-like or dancing movement        |
| Athetosis      | writhing movement                    |
| tics           | small twitches or jumps              |
| myoclonus      | large muscle jerks                   |
| ballism        | flinging of entire limbs             |
| fasciculations | small twitches underneath the skin   |

## sensory exam
normal:
nl pin prick (PP), vibration, and proprioception


| Test           | pathway                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| PP             | Spinal thalamic tract                        |
| vib            | medial meniscus tract                        |
| proprioception | medial meniscus tract and 4 cerebellar tract |
proprioception test:
hold pt finger by the side and move it up and down. have them close their eyes and tell you when the finger is up and when down. if they fail move onto other in the same hand and move up the limb. If they succeed, move onto the next hand or food

Vib:
do the same pattern with a tuning fork and have pt tell you when it is vibrating 

PP:
use safety pin and prick each dermatome. poke with the dull side of pin from time to time to make sure that are not lying to you

Optional: TP discrimination
cortical lesion: lack of stereognosis (IDing item in hand blind); or lack of graphesthesia (understand numbers or letters drawn into the palm blind)

## coordination
Normal:
finger to nose and heel to shin nl. OR finger taps, rapid alternating movements nl.

test: have pt touch their nose and quickly have pt touch your finger continue quickly back and forth

> dysmetria (hyper-, hypo-): goes to far or not far enough
   intention tremor: jittering around target

supinate pt. have pt place on heel on the opposite knee

Finger taps: tap alternating fingers together
rapid alternating movement: flip hand on the table repeatedly

## reflexes

2 symmetric throughout plantar response flexor

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">test: hit them with a hammer</mark>

| --------------- | --- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Achilles        | S1  | x/4   | relax foot, flex slightly, hit tendon                                  |
| Patellar        | L4  | x/4   | hit tendon                                                             |
| Brachioradialis | C5  | x/4   | hit tendon                                                             |
| Biceps Brachii  | C6  | x/4   | place finger on tendon and hit your finger with hammer                 |
| Triceps         | C7  | x/4   | optional: have them hang their shoulders like a scare crow, hit tendon |

| Score | response              |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 0     | no reflex             |
| 1     | decreased             |
| 2     | nl (average)          |
| 3     | increased             |
| 4     | increased with clonus |
4 and asymmetry is always pathologic
0s and 1s are only worrying in young people

if someone cannot relax have them do the Jendrassik maneuver 

signs of spasticity (upper motor neuron disease):

## gait and station

Normal:
nl good tandem negative Romberg sign 

Romberg sign: have pt close their eyes. if they can stand they are normal. if they fall, neuro damage

Tandem: have pt walk heel to toe. 

gaits:

| name         | gait                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| ataxia       | drunken                        |
| apraxia      | bent over “stuck on the floor” |
| scissor      | legs cept straigt              |
| spastic      | one leg kept straight          |
| steppage     | lifting knees high             |
| parkinsonian | similar to apraxia             |
