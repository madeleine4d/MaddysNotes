Most reactions are hemi-acetal or [[acetal]]

carbohydrates are made up of aldose (aldehyde R group) and ketose (ketone R group)

### Reduction and oxidation of monosaccharides
following the general process of carboxylic acid → aldehyde → alcohol reduction pathway, the aldehyde at the end of a sugar can be reduced into a alcohol (resulting in a alditol)

the reverse is also true:

### shortening sugar chains
Wohl degradation

### extending sugar chain
Kiliani-Fischer synthesis 
Pd/BaSO4 is a poisoned reagent, meaning it stops a reduction

### cyclization

caused by a hemi-[[acetal]] reaction between the OH on C-5 and the aldehyde oxygen on C-1

### Anomers
$\alpha$ sugars have aminergic OH on the opposite side as the CH2OH

### Formation of glycosides
monosaccharides link together to form polysaccharides via hemi-[[acetal]]
