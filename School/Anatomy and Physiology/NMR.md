Steps for NMR with structure given:
1. label groups of unique hydrogens ($H_{a},\space H_{b}, \space H_{c} \space ...$)
2. how many signals would you expect to see? do you see that?
3. match each group of H to a trace
4. profit

Steps for NMR without structure given:
1. look for common solvent traces and discard
2. 


Integral values:
indicates the area under the curve and corresponds to the number of H in that group of unique H.

Shielding and de-shielding:
O and N can draw away electrons (shielding) but can also donate electrons via resonance (de-shielding)
Shielding causes an decrease in ppm and de-shielding does the inverse
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">resonance supersedes induction</mark> 

H-bond donators:
allows proton to associated and dissociate on and off of the molecule, this causes a broad peak. OH and Amines are the most common examples.

Locked Bonds:
if, due to non-rotating bonds, two unique hydrogen groups are on the same non-H atom, both groups split the trace of adjacent H. This results in a splitting of the splitting (ex. doublet of triplets)
