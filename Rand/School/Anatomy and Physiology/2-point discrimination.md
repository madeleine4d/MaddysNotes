##### Factors:
- size of receptor field per afferent neuron
	- The smaller the field the better 2-point discrimination
* [[sensory receptor]] density
	* higher density, higher 2-point discrimination
* [[lateral inhibition]]
	* greater lateral inhibition, greater 2-point discrimination
* convergence of first order neurons on to second order neurons
	* Less convergence, better 2-point discrimination
