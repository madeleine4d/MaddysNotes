An opening, often selective, that allows molecules across the [[Cell Membrane]]. Allows [[simple diffusion]] across a membrane that would not normally be permeable to that molecule.

#### voltage gated
opens and closes due to a **change in voltage**. Example: sodium and potassium voltage gated channels open at about -55 mV these are an important part of an [[action potential]]

#### ligand gated
Opens and closes due to the **binding of a ligand**. Example: sodium and potassium channels near the synapses are bound by signaling chemicals to start an [[graded potential]]

#### leak 
a constantly open channel that lets a small amount of a specific molecule to cross the membrane. Example: potassium leak channels also potassium out of the cell to build the [[Membrane Potential]]
