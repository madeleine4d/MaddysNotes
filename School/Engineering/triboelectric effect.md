Charged ions can be exchanged from one object to another via sliding against one another. Charge change is achieved by the movement of [[charge|electrons]] from one object to another.

this effect most commonly occurs with [[Insulators]] and the [[charge]] induced is conserved and exists on the surface of the object.
