(Deoxyribonucleic acid)
The "language" in which the [[Genes]] of most organism is written
#review
##### Basics of DNA
- Double helix structure
- 5’ to 3’ ends
	- 5’ is the side of the monomer with the phosphate
- both helices run in opposite directions (one 5’ to 3’ and the other 3’ to 5’)
- Alanine (A), Tyrosine (T), Cyanine (C), and Guanine (G) are called base pairs
    - A forms 2 [[H-bonds]] to T
    - C forms 3 [[H-bonds]] to G
    - This is built in redundancy: if one base pair is damaged or removed the other member of the pair can be used to replace it
- DNA can replicated ([[DNA Replication]]) by splitting in half and replacing each missing base pair member, making two chains. This is the [[semi-conservative model]]

##### Formation of Nucleotides
[[Condensation reaction]] attach sugar and base, then adds phosphate(s)

The first [[phosphate]] can attach to the 3' OH of an adjacent deoxyribose. The remaining phosphates are hydrolyzed by water to release needed energy.
