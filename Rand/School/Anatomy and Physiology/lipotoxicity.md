A high concentration of fat in non-[[adipocytes]]. Most often in [[muscle tissue#Skeletal Muscle|skeletal muscle]] and [[liver]]. 

Caused by high levels of circulating fatty acids concentration, often the result [[insulin#resistance|insulin resistance]]. In turn, liptoxicity can increase [[insulin#resistance|insulin resistance]] and free fatty acid concentration. 

Lipotoxicity is only pathologic if the TAGs are not able to be broken down. Trained people often have high TAG concentrations in muscle cells than untrained but do not show metabolic symptoms.
