derived from mesenchymal stem cells → adipoblasts → preadipocytes → immature adipocytes → mature adipocytes

Stores lipids for energy, [[lipogenesis]] and [[lipolysis]], produce endocrine hormones, and structural support

Key transcription factors for this maturation are:
- SREBP-1 (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1):
	- induces an increase in fat synthesis, requiring more adipocytes to store those lipids
- PPARγ (peroxisome procofactor activated receptor γ):
	- induces an increase in fat synthesis, requiring more adipocytes to store those lipids

Types of adipocytes:
- brown: produces heat and activated by exposure to cold; present in babies, less so in adults
- white: primary storage for [[triglycerides]]
- active/inactive beige:
