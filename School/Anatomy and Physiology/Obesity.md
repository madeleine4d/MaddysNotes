### fat oxidation and storage
Due to [[insulin#resistance|insulin resistance]] free fatty acids build up in the blood, however, [[CPT1]] (which allows FFAs into the mitochondria) causing all fat to be directed to the ER to be made into TAG. Some TAG is stored and some goes into circulation.

### Inflammation 
obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, characterized by and increase in macrophage activity in [[adipose tissue]]. 
This inflammation differs from [[autoimmune]] conditions.
Directly linked to [[insulin#resistance|insulin resistance]].

physiology:
- expanding adiposity causes hypoxia in adipocytes
- this causes cell death and a cytokine storm that takes a long time to resolve due to low cell turn over and poor [[vascularization]]
- This cytokine storm causes the recruitment of [[immune response]] and polarization of [[macrophages]]
So given enough time and with consistent adiposity, this effect can be reduced.

### appetite
[[insulin]] and [[leptin]] both suppress appetite, however, in obese patients insulin resistance is common. This lessens the effects of both insulin and leptin.

obesity reduces the ability to sense sugar and changes the feeding reward response.![[Pasted image 20250205081227.png]]

#### usual appetite suppression:

#### hormone changes after weight loss
After caloric restriction, in [this](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1105816) study, [[ghrelin]] was increased, while [[PPY]], [[CCK]] and [[amylin]] were all reducedâ€”increasing hunger and desire to eat. However, this effect was attenuated after 62 weeks. This suggests that baseline weight can be permanently changed.
