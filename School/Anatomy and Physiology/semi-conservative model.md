- There is also a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Conservative model</mark> that looks like this:

##### Experiments used to find model

- Centrifuging a concentration gradient slurry with experiment molecules you can find relative density
- E coli was incubated with either N14 or 15. N15 is heavier so we can determine which is present
- two distinct bands would be expected from the conservative this was not found and conservative was rejected
- when another generation is formed with more N14, two bands are found. This would only be consistent with the formation of N14-N14 and N15-N14. This shows that dispersive model is incorrect, where only one line at the average between N14 and N15
