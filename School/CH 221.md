## Notes

Core to chem: the properties and behavior of small particles (atoms and molecules) result in all of the things that we observe on a macro scale

## Math

### Energy Calculations

Heat = Mass X Specific Heat Cap X Change it Temp

> $$q (\degree c) = m(g) * C(Kj/g/\degree c) * \Delta t(\degree c)$$

### Dimensional Analysis (statements)
![[Untitled.png]]

### Average Atomic mass

$\sum{(m * f)}$ Where $m$ is the mass of a given isotope and $f$ is its abundance as a decimal percent.

<aside> ðŸ‘‰ $(68.9256_{amu} * 0.6011) + (70.9247_{amu} * 0.3983) = 69.72_{amu}$

</aside>

### Stoichiometry (relative measurement math)

You can use Dimensional Analysis to find the relationship between the components of a reaction.

Given $\ce{2Al +3CuCl2 -> 2AlCl3 + 3Cu}$ These relationships exist: $\ce{2Al \equiv 3CuCl2 \equiv 2AlCl3 \equiv 3 Cu}$. These ratios can be used in dimensional analysis (below)

$\ce{6.0gCuCl2 *{\ce{1molCuCl2} \over \ce{124.45g}} * {\ce{2AlCl3} \over \ce{3CuCl2}} = \ce{0.0605molAlCl3}}$

**Dimensional Analysis**
m
1. 12 bottles / case, 2kg / bottle, 1.20$/lb
2. Price of 12 bottles
3. Dollars
4. unit conversion for kg to lb
5. 12 bottles * 2kg // kg to lb *1.20$

$12bottles * {2kg\over1bottle} * {2.20lb\over1kg} * {1.20usd\over 1lb} = 63.36$

### Find Limiting Reactants

If the quantity of only one reactant is know than it is assumed to be the limiting reactant

find the reactant that make the least product

 $\ce{6.0gCuCl2 *{\ce{1molCuCl2} \over \ce{124.45g}} * {\ce{2mol AlCl3} \over \ce{3mol CuCl2}} = \ce{0.0605mol AlCl3}}$

$\ce{6.0gAl * {\ce{1molCuCl2}\over \ce{26.98g}} * {\ce{2mol AlCl3}\over \ce{2mol Al}}} = \ce{0.2224mol AlCl3}$

Copper chloride is the limiting reactant.


### % yield
${Actual\ Yield \over Ideal\ Yield} * 100\% = \%\ Yield$


### Mass %

$\ce{mass \% = {mass Cl \over mass CCl_4} = mass \% of Cl in CCl4}$

$\ce{{4(35.45g)\over 153.81g} = 92.19\%}$

### Finding Empirical Formulas

Find the number of moles in 100g. divide both moles by the smallest quantity of moles. round proportion to nearest whole numbers if with in 0.1. If they do not round easily multiply all by whole numbers until it is easily multiplied

## Definitions

### Oxidization Numbers

1. The oxidation number of an atom is zero in a neutral substance that contains atoms of only one element. Thus, the atoms in O2, O3, P4, S8, and aluminum metal all have an oxidation number of 0.
    
2. The oxidation number of simple ions is equal to the charge on the ion. The oxidation number of sodium in the Na+ ion is +1, for example, and the oxidation number of chlorine in the Cl- ion is -1.
    
3. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1 when it is combined with a _nonmetal_ as in CH4, NH3, H2O, and HCl.
    
4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is -1 when it is combined with a _metal_ as in. LiH, NaH, CaH2, and LiAlH4.
    
5. The metals in Group IA form compounds (such as Li3N and Na2S) in which the metal atom has an oxidation number of +1.
    
6. The elements in Group IIA form compounds (such as Mg3N2 and CaCO3) in which the metal atom has a +2 oxidation number.
    
7. Oxygen usually has an oxidation number of -2. Exceptions include molecules and polyatomic ions that contain O-O bonds, such as O2, O3, H2O2, and the O22- ion.
    
8. The elements in Group VIIA often form compounds (such as AlF3, HCl, and ZnBr2) in which the nonmetal has a -1 oxidation number.
    
9. The sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is zero.
    

### Solubility Rules

### Acids and Bases

- Acids produce H+ ions when dissolved in water. H3O+ is actually formed but we use H+
    - Always has an H in formula
- Bases produce OH- ions when dissolved in water
- Acids and bases neutralize when mixed forming H2O and a salt
    - Energy is lowered by the formation of water
- Weak acids only dissociates partially; strong acids dissociate completely
- To balance acid base reaction all we need to do is balance the H+ and OH-

### Molarity ($M$)

$M = {\ce{mols} \over \ce{1L}}$

$mols = M * L$

For dilution: $M_{conc}V_{conc}=M_{dilu}V_{dilu}$

### Energy

**Energy:** The ability to do work

Energy is **Always** involved in physical and chemical changes

Kinetic: Motion (heat, etc) $E_{KE}$

Potential: Position $E_{PE}$

<aside> ðŸ’¡ All systems "move to a lower energy state. Moving from a higher energy state (less stable) to a lower energy state (more stable). This is why any everything happens

</aside>

### Volume = L * W * H

Extensive

SI unit: $m^3$

$dm^3$ = L

mL = $cm^3$

### Density = m/V, $\rho$

Intensive

temperature dependent

### Matter (types)

- Pure substance
    - Element (contains only 1 "type" of atom)
    - Compound (contains multiple "types" of atoms)
- Mixtures
    - heterogeneous (can easily be separated / parts are visualize-able)
    - homogeneous (can not be easily separated / parts are not visualize-able)

### Atomic nomenclature($_z^AX$)

$_z^AX$ , A = Mass ($p^++n^0$), Z = atomic number ($p^+$), X = atomic symbol

Unit of atomic mass is $amu$ defined as ${1\over12} _6^{12}C$

### Bonding

Ionic bond: electrons are transferred between atoms in a compound

- created from a metal and a non metal
    - the metal becomes a cation by giving up one or more electrons
    - the non metal accepts one or more extra electron(s) and becomes a anion
- write cation then anion with out charges. anion changes to -ide suffix
- create ion pairs not molecules
- variable ion elements get stocks (ii) or (iii) etc.
- many ionic compounds coordinate with water $\ce{*5H2O}$
- polyatomic ions: multi atom ion $\ce{Fe(NO3)2}$
    - does not does not disassociate when dissolved.

Covalent bond: electrons are shared between atoms in a compound

- Create by two or more non metals
- diatomic (have no fear of ice cold bear / $\ce{H2, N2, F2, O2, I2, C2, B2}$)
- name with prefixes for all parts
- replace last element suffix with -ide
- order elements from least to more reactivity (left to right bottom to top)
- Acids
    - must be aq
    - $\ce{H+ + polyatomic ion}$
    - "hydro" + anion root + "ic" followed by "acid"
    - for polyatomic anions do not use the "hydro"
    - ate becomes ic
    - ite becomes ous

### Moles

counting unit like a dozen

1 mole = $6.02214154 * 10^{23}$ = 602,214,154,000,000,000,000,000

1 mole $\ce{^12C = 12g}$ (exactly)

1 atom = x amu

1 mole = x g

molar mass can be notated MM.

### Chemical Formulas

- Empirical Formula
    - the smallest whole number ratio
    - all ionic formulas are empirical
    - butane $\ce{C2H5}$
- Molecular Formula
    - the actual number of atoms in the molecule
    - butane $\ce{C4H10}$

### Electrolytes

- Charged ions in a solution of water are conductive because the ions are able to move much like electrons in a wire
    - Cations [[Flow]] to the negative wire and anion [[Flow]] to the positive wire
- We can use this to figure out is a substance is ionic and disassociates or is not and does not
    - If it makes water conductive it is an ion
    - If it does not than it is not an ion
- All soluble ionic compound disassociate completely
- Polyatomic ions do not disassociate further

## History

### 3 Mass Laws

- Mass conversion. matter can not be created or destroyed.
    - The mass of all reactants in a reaction is **always** equal to the mass of all products.
- Definite proportions. all compounds contain the same proportion of elements as any compound of the same type
- Multiple Proportions. elements combine in small whole number ratios

### Dolton:

1. all matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. can not be created or destroyed
2. can not be converted to different atom
3. all atoms are identical (H is H) but differ from other elements
4. compounds result from the chemical combination of a specific ration of atoms of different elements

### Dev of modern atomic theory

we knew:

- 2 types of electrical charge
- opposite charges attract
- like charges repel
- mag field reflect charged partials

J. J. Thomson 1897:

- atoms contain negatively charged particles (electrons)
- most things are neutrally charged so atoms must have a equal positive charge
- atoms are like plum putting electrons and protons are equally distributed in the atom.

Rutherford

- reinforced the "planetary" model of an atom. using a beam of positively charged alpha particles through thin gold foil.
