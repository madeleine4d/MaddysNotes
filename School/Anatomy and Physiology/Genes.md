The unit of function of [[DNA]]. Consisting of many base pairs

### How was this figured out

- An [[Auxotroph]] is a e. coli cell than can not survive in minimal media. This is likely because it is missing an vital enzyme
- When a wild type bacteria is given is mutagen [[Auxotroph]] will form. If all cells are plated and grown out they can then be replated with minimal media. All the cells that did not grow after transfer must be Auxotrophs
- to find a [[Auxotroph]] that does not make one specific compound cells can be plated with that molecule and minimal media then transferred to a plate containing only minimal media.
- You can add two chromosome into one cells. This allows you to tell if a mutation adds something or takes something away.
- If you place mutant and wild type DNA together and the cell has the wild type phenotype than the mutant is missing something compared to the wild type. In this case the wild type if dominant and the mutant is recessive.
- If two recessive chromosomes are added together, and are missing different things, the resulting cell will have wild type phenotype. But if the cell are missing the same thing or if DNA does not have subunits that would code of a missing thing the cell would still be mutant
- If both are missing the same thing they fail to complement but if they have different missing things they complement
