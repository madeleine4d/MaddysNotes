The movement of a substance from one place to another. Flow occurs due to a energy gradient. The magnitude ("steepness") of the gradient effects the magnitude of flow. Like vectors, more than one gradient can effect magnitude and direction of flow. There is always resistance to flow (Newton's first law).
