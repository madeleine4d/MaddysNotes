In [organic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry "Organic chemistry"), a **condensation reaction** is a type of [chemical reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction") in which two [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") are [combined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_reaction "Combination reaction") to form a single molecule, usually with the loss of a small molecule such as [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water").[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_reaction#cite_note-1) If water is lost, the reaction is also known as a [dehydration synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration_reaction "Dehydration reaction"). However other molecules can also be lost, such as [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia"), [ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol "Ethanol"), [acetic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid "Acetic acid") and [hydrogen sulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide "Hydrogen sulfide").[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_reaction#cite_note-2)
