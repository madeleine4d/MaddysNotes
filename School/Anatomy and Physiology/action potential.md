Stimulus (ligand gated channels) allow Na+ into the cell raising the [[Membrane Potential]]. If the [[Membrane Potential]] reaches a threshold value of -55 mV, the action potential is activated. [[Membrane Potential]] change due to ligand gated channels is called [[graded potential]]. After action potential occurs their is a [[refractory period]].

### Autorhythmic cells (pacemaker cells):
![[Pasted image 20240111101229.png]]
1. Pacemaker potential: "Funny channels" ($I_f$) open at low voltage (-60 mV) allowing a slow influx of $Na^+$. $K^+$ channels close and transient (T-type) $Ca^{2+}$ open just before threshold is reached allowing a influx and close at threshold.
2. Depolarization: Threshold is reached. long-lasting (L-type) $Ca^{2+}$ channels open causing a large $Ca^{2+}$ influx.
3. Repolarization: $K^+$ channels open allowing a efflux of $K^+$; L-type $Ca^{2+}$ channels close
4. Hyperpolarization: $K^+$ channels slowly close. minimal potential is reached allowing "Funny channels" to open and starting pacemaker potential.

#### 3 Types of Autorhythmic cells:
Three categories have different speeds of pacemaker potential meaning they fire at different rates.
- SA node cells: 70-80 AP/min
- AV node cells: 40-60 AP/min
- Bundle and Purkinje fiber cells: 20-40 AP/min
The fastest rhythm sets the pace for all other cell connected to the network. This means that, in normal conditions, the SA node sets the rhythm of the heart.

### Contractile cells:

1. Rapid Depolarization: threshold is reached via the depolarization of adjacent cells. When threshold is reached, $Na^+$ channels open allowing influx.
2. Initial repolarization: $Na^+$ channels close. T-type $K^+$ channels open and quickly close, allowing a brief efflux of $K^+$. 
3. Plateau: L-type $Ca^{2+}$ channels open, allowing $Ca^{2+}$ influx. $K^+$ efflux slows but continues.
4. repolarization: L-type $Ca^{2+}$ close. Standard voltage-gated $K^+$ channels open, allowing large efflux of $K^+$.


## Neuro action potentials
### measurement

A is giving action potentials, while B-D hive summed APs
EEG is only able to measure parallel neurons, because the APs need to sum and not cancel
