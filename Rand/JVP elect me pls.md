Hello my name is Madeleine Ford and I am a 4th year Human Physiology major, but don’t worry I will be sticking around next year. I am also a student worker and an organizer for our union, and for YDSA’s socialist feminist committee. Last year I was involved in the encampment where I primarily worked in the medical tent; and I have been involved in pro-Palestine activism both before and after. I am also in the process of converting to Judaism and go to TBI every weekend (let me know if you ever want to come with me!). I can offer this club all of my organizing experience and I want to contribute my religious learning to JVP cultural events and holidays
