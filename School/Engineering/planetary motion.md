### Keplerâ€™s Laws
![[Kepler_laws_diagram.svg 1.png]]
1. planetary orbits are ellipses (sometime simplified to circles in low level college physics) with their star as one foci
2. A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
3. The square of a planet's [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") is proportional to the cube of the length of the [semi-major axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_and_semi-minor_axes "Semi-major and semi-minor axes") of its orbit.
