One of the two parts of the [[cardiovascular system]] with [[blood vessels]].

#### Basic Cardiovascular systems:
![[Pasted image 20240109101712.png]]
This system is monodirectional due to heart valves and valves in blood vessels. These valves open and close passively according to pressure gradients. 
### Structural Features:
The heart is surrounded by the [[pericardium]]. 

##### Valves:
**AV Valves:** 
between the atrium and ventricle on both the right and left side.
- tricuspid on the right side
- bicuspid on the left side
**Semilunar Valves:**
between the great vessels and the atrium on both sides.
- the aortic valve is on the left at the [[aorta]]
- the pulmonary valve is on the right at the [[pulmonary trunk]]

##### Fibrous Skeleton
The fibrous skeleton consists of 4 rings. One around each valve all on one plane. These rings also separate the chambers of the heart and act as electrical insulators. This means that electrical current can only move from chamber to chamber at the SA node.

##### Muscle
The cardiac muscle makes up the middle layer of the cardiac wall called the **myocardium**.
