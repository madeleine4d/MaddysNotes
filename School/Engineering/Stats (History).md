<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Ronald fisher</mark>: is preparing tea for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Muriel Bristol</mark> but he messes up the preparation order according to his guest. He believes that the order does not matter. A blind taste test could be used to answer this question. Eight cups were prepared—four milk first, four tea first. Muriel guessed all eight correct. 

What do we know from this?
	- essentially nothing because it is always possible that she guesses, even with many many cups of tea. This is where we need stats
	- However, we can place a probability on her being able to randomly guess the “correct” answer, but not the probability that she is capable to telling the difference. In this case that probability is 1/70.
