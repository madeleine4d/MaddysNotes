*Flux* can be thought as the “amount” of [[electric field]] that passes through a given area.

## Gauss’s law
$$\Phi_{E} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}}=\int_{S} \vec{E} \cdot dA $$
The integral is only necessary for inconsistent [[electric field]] otherwise $\Phi_{E}=\vec{E}\cdot\vec{A}$

## Surfaces
Closed surfaces have a definable volume while open surfaces do not. Opened surfaces include planes, thin disk, or a triangle.
