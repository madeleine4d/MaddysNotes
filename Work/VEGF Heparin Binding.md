The most common form of VEGF responsible for angiogenesis is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">VEGFA165</mark> and will be referred to as VEGF from this point on.

VEGF monomer has one HBD. This domain can be removed via proteases such as plasmin and MMP3 making heparin bindable GF into soluble.

Heparin binding increases angiogenesis:

Furthermore, the character of the newly formed blood vessels was different. With increased heparin binding tissues "exhibit dense, highly branched networks of small diameter blood vessels". As apposed to wider, less branched, and more permeable vessels from VEGF with less heparin binding.
