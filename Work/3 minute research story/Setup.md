*The big picture of what my research group does*

My lab works on therapeutic protein delivery. We use affinity base protein-binders along with hydrogels to deliver a wide array of proteins to specific tissue injuries over physiologically relevant time frames. We specifically focus on the repair of bone and vasculature.
