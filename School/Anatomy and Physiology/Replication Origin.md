- E coli. only has one origin in its whole genome meaning that, that one origin is the only one used every time
- Humans have multiple origins. This creates two forks that will meet at some point
- **************End replication problem:************** When RNase H removed a primer at the very end of a linear there is no way for this DNA to be replicated.
- Telomeres are used in some animals including humans to get around this problem. A Telomerase enzyme adds these short sections of DNA
- this sequence is not used to store genetic material and is just there to fill space. They are sacrificed during replication
- Most of our cells do not have enough telomerase to reproduce indefinitely. this causes disease and cell death over time
