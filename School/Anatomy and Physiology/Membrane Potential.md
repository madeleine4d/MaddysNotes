A difference in charge across a [[Cell Membrane]]. Most often measured from the inside. This is an localized effect, meaning that one part of a membrane can have a different potential in different places.

Membrane potential is most often cause by a electrochemical gradient. like the one created by [[Sodium-Potassium ATPase]]. Second, it requires leak channels (see [[Channel Proteins]]) that allow specific ions through the [[Cell Membrane]].

when charge force and concentration forces balance it is called [[equilibrium potential]]

When membrane potential changes greatly it is called [[action potential ]]

Membrane potential can be calculated from the concentrations and charges of all relevent ions using the [[equilibrium potential#Goldman Equation]]
