## Direct Cortical Electrical stimulation
electrical shocks around the central sulcus causes sensation (postcentral gyrus) and motor movements (precentral gyrus). The effect is location dependent and follow the below diagram

even small probes activate cells about 4 mm away from probe, because electric potentials can travel between local neurons

## Electroconvulsive therapy
small electric currents through brain to cause a seizure as treatment for psychiatric disorders like depression, mania, catatonia, and aggression due to dementia. Very effective and quick. done under GE.

## Transcranial magnetic stimulation
changes in [[magnetic field]] can be used to induce [[current]] and cause electric stimulation through the cranium. single pulse: used for activating deeper neurons like when stimulating precentral gyrus (MEP). pair pulse: reduces motor response (SICI: short-interval intercortical inhibition) measures intercortical inhibition. TCI (transcallosal inhibition) stimulation on one side followed by stimulation on the other side shows lower activity on the second pulse. CSP (cortical silent period) after a MEP the cells cannot reactivate for a little bit and it an index of intracortical inhibition.

## Transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS) makes neurons more or less likely to depolarize transcranially. 1 hr after effects. positive effects are in questions.![[Pasted image 20250421154403.png]]
