>Impaired healing is prevalent in individuals who suffer from diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, renal disease, or obesity and can lead to the development of nonhealing chronic wounds [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006423002296?via%3Dihub#bib1),[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006423002296?via%3Dihub#bib2)]. Chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the USA [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006423002296?via%3Dihub#bib3)]. In 2022, the global chronic wound care market was $12.3 billion (USD) and is projected to be over $19 billion by 2029 [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006423002296?via%3Dihub#bib4).
