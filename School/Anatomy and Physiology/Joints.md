# Synovial Joints

## Stability
- Amount of surface area of contact (the more surface area contact the more stability)
	- This can change through movement. For example when the knee is extended the surface area contact increases and the joint become more stable (i.e. does not allow for rotation)
	- High contact area is called tight packed and low contact area is called loose pack
#### Dislocation
#### of the[[shoulder girdle | shoulder]]
- accounts for almost half of all dislocations
- about 85% dislocate anteriorly 
#### of the [[Knee Joint|knee]]
- NOT the dislocation of the [[patella]]
- dislocation of the articulating surfaces of the [[femur]] and [[tibia]]
