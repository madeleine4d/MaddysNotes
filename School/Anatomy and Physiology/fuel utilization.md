#### carbo-loading
- can increase stored glycogen
- depletion of glycogen is not necessary

long duration of moderate work, fats become more dominant over time.

#### increasing fat metabolism
- exercising increases [[epinephrine]]
- [[epinephrine]] increases the release of [[FFA]] from adipocytes
- [[FFA]] is transported by [[albumin]]
- [[FFA]] crosses the muscle membrane and enters [[beta-oxidation]]
- ![[Pasted image 20240609155435.png]]
- The use of [[beta-oxidation]] pathways block the entry of glycolytic [[pyruvate]] into the [[mitochondria]]. 
- additionally, [[citrate]] from [[beta-oxidation]] inhibits [[PFK]] and leads to a back up up the [[glycolysis]] pathway.

#### glucose utilization

glucose utilization increases with intensity. Relative glucose utilization decreases over time but liver glucose production increases to make up for the loss of muscle glycogen. 

#### diet and fuel utilization

high fat diet decreases fatigue time
