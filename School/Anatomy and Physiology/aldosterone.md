#### Function
Effects the [[kidney]] to increase [[sodium]] reabsorption and decrease reabsorption [[Potassium]]. [[water]] follows the increase in [[molarity]] and increases [[blood]] volume and [[blood pressure]]. [[hydronium]] is also secreted increasing [[pH]].

#### Regulation
Generally low [[sodium]] and high [[Potassium]] simulates the release of aldosterone. There are two pathways through which this can occur.

Low [[sodium]], [[blood]] volume, and [[blood pressure]] causes the release of [[renin]] which leads to the release of [[angiotensin]].

Second, [[blood]] [[Potassium]] concentration directly regulate the release of aldosterone.
