Large magnetic field that is always present during scan.

two common perspective/orientation
Neurological (your right = pt right); like a surgeon at top the pt
radiological (your right = pt left); like a radiologist at feet of pt

## standard weighting
T1 weight: relaxation time
T2 weight: precession rate (spin rate)

Angiography is possible via injection of contrast agent (gadolinium) shows up very bright on a T1

## Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)
detects water. water travel in the same direction (uniform diffusivity) causes a bright spot.

#### DTI 
more diffusion moves along axons, looking at 3d DWI can show fiber tracts. This can show structural connectivity.
Good for surgery planning and can find edema

## Functional MRI
Measures metabolic correlates of neural activity

PET (positron emission tomography):
looking at gamma rays from radioactive inject tracer, behave like specific biologic molecules

fMRI:
shows changes in oxygenated heme analogues to neural activity. Low temporal resolution
