- An initial protein is able to bind an [[Replication Origin]] along the dsDNA. This opens a small area of the double helix into two single strands.

- Helicase unwinds this opening to create a larger area of single stranded DNA

- Primers attach to the newly opened single stranded DNA. Primers are made by primase enzyme out of RNA
- This primer is required for DNA polymerase to replicate the single strands
- Polymerase (pol) forms from 3’ end to 5’ end
- Polymerase III is responsible for making most of the new DNA. It forms DNA continuously from the 3’ end of a primer

- Because DNA Pol III can only add to one end, new primers are formed behind the main strand of DNA (leading strand). More DNA Pol III forms more DNA strands from these primers (lagging strand)

- RNase H removed all but the last base of the primers. DNA Pol I fills in the gap and removed the last RNA base
- ligase then connects the backbone to make continuous DNA
