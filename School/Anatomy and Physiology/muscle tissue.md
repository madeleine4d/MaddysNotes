#### Cardiac Muscle
##### General 
- Cells are called cardiomyocytes
- branching chains of the cells
- 1-2 nuclei
- shorter and wider
- increased mitochondria
- intercalated discs
	- [[desmosomes]]
	- [[gap junctions]]
##### Contractile cells
- cause the heart to contract 
- about 99% of the the cardiac muscle
##### autorhythmic (pacemaker) cells
- initiate and conduct [[action potential]]s
- about 1% of the cardiac muscle
- maintains heart rate independently but reactive to the CNS and PNS

**See** [[action potential#Cardiac action potentials|cardiac action potentials]]
#### Skeletal Muscle
[[muscle shape classification]]
##### function
- force generation
- heat production 
- glucose uptake and storage 
- regulation of metabolic rate 
- source of [[amino acid]]
length: 3 mm to 30 cm
CSA: 2000-7500 um^2


#### Contraction
**Eccentric contraction**
Muscle is contracting while lengthening.

**Concentric contraction**
muscle is contracting and shortening.

Isometric contraction
Muscle is contracting while staying the same length.

##### Endomysium 
surrounds muscle fiber and is made out of alreolar conective tissue
##### Perimysium
Sounds a group of fibers forming a muscle bundle
##### Epimysium 
surrounds groups of bundles, forming muscles. Dens irregular conective tissue
