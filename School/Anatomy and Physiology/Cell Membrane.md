Made up of a fluid [[phospholipid]] bilayer. [[cholesterol ]] present in the membrane allows for more stabile fluidity with increased and decreased temperatures. Only small and lipid soluble compounds are able to cross the cell membrane via [[simple diffusion]]. Charged compounds of any kind cannot cross the membrane in a meaningful manner. 

##### Funcions:
- selective barrier
- sense and respond to stimulus
- create electrochemical paternal ([[Membrane Potential]])


##### Membrane proteins 
[NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26878/)
- [[Channel Proteins]]
- [[Carrier Proteins]]
- [[Transport Proteins]]
- [[structure proteins]]
membrane proteins are able to [[Flow]] across the surface of the cell, a process called *lateral movement*.
