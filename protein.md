## primary structure
based solely on the [[amino acid]] sequence

## secondary structure
based on [[H-bonds]] between donaters and accepters on the backbone

## tertiary structure
based on primary and secondary structures, as well as side chain effects. describes the exact folding pattern of the protein. If folding changes from physiologically active form even a small amount it becomes inactive 

structure is dictated by…
1. [[H-bonds]]
2. salt bridges
3. hydrophobic effects
4. disulfide bonds
5. pi-stacking

## quaternary structure
“multimerality”
