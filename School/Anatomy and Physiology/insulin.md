A protein hormone produced by beta cells in the [[Pancreas]]. Pivotal in controlling [[blood glucose]].

- binding of insulin to insulin receptor causes the receptor to dimerize.
- signals [[GLUT]]-4 to begin uptake of [[glucose]].
**other effects**:
- increases [[lipogenesis]]
- decreases [[lipolysis]]
### resistance
more insulin is need to have the same effect in health people. Can cause lower insulin activity despite higher circulating concentrations. This can lead to things like [[lipotoxicity]] and [[diabetes]]. 

**FFA**: more free fatty acid build up in the cell causes an increase in PKC which inhibits the insulin cascade.

Leptin resistance: insulin resistance caused the activity of [[leptin]] to decrease. This causes less appetites suppression from both insulin and leptin

[[adipocytes]] size effects insulin resistance:
- smaller [[adipocytes]] are more easily vascularized and show less inflammation
- when [[adipocytes]] increase in size they fiberize making it more difficult of O2 to diffuse across the membrane worsening [[hypoxia]]
- fibrosis also decreases the ability for [[adipocytes]] release and break down [[triglycerides]]
- this seems to only be a problem in visceral fat
