$\text{if } \{E_{1}, E_{2}, \dots\}\text{ is a pratition of the outcome set, and E is any event, then \_\_\_\_\_}=$
$Pr(E_{1})\cdot Pr(E|E_{1})+Pr(E_{2})\cdot PR(E|E_{2})+...$



### Example: you might have the plague
false pos: 1/1000
false neg: 1/1000

B is the event where you have the plague AND p is the event that you test positive.

$Pr(P|B ') = \frac{1}{1000}$

$Pr(P|B) = \frac{999}{1000}$

$P(B|P)=P(B\cap P)$
