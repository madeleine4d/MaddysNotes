Hemi-acetal results from one quiv of ROH and results in only one OR group and a OH group.

### mechanism

1) Carbonyl is protonated

2) Neutrophilic attack by the ROH

3) deprotonate to form hemi-acetal (hemi-acetal mechanism stops here)

4) protonation of alcohol

5) removal of H2O

7) deprotonate by H2O
