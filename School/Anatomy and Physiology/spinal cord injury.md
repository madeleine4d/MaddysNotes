## Epidemiology

- 15.4 million people living with SCI
- US has highest rate
	- violent crime
	- self harm
	- guns
- male more common
- 15-30 or over 60



## Etiology
- 90% are traumatic
	- traffic acidents are most comon
	- falls is 2nd
	- sport injury 3rd
- 10% are non-traumatic
	- tumors for example
can result in paraplegia, hemiplegia or tetraplegia, this is caused by complete or non complete injuries at different levels

primary injury:
initial damage from trauma that cases more physiological dysfunction and ischemia (secondary injury). Inflamation continues to dammage the cord

2 weeks - 6 months:
cystic cavitation and glial scars form. heavily limits healing, but retains physiological dysfunction to site of injury

## dx
- neuron exam
- imaging
	- xray
	- MRI
	- CT
- ISNCSCI score
	- Motor score (myotomes)
	- Sensory score (dermatomes)
	- Impairment score
## prognosis
- some recovery years after is possible but mostly occurs within 6 months
- Grade A have a 5% chance of walking again
- lower life expediencies
